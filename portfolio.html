                This is a portfolio of things that I have learned and expierienced during my stay here at UCI. 
                I am thankful to all the faculty, staff, and peers that have made these possible and made me improve beyond my expectations.

                I had the opportunity to gain hands on experience in requirements engineering through a collaborative class project. 
                Our team closely worked to elicit stakeholders to find goals, vision and scope for a mock Chocolaterie. 
                We made devliverables which changed rapidly with many iterations, validating with stakeholders each step.
                I had a lot of learning experiences in this class, including learning how to optimize and get the best possible value with the little time we had with stakeholders.
                Maintaining contact, always asking questions, and adapting to a new envioroment of different RE phases and techniques.

                Discord Redesign.
            </h1>
            <h2 class = "bodyShrink portColorSize">
                In this project we needed to find a possible issue in an application, investigate, and devise a solution.
                Discord had a very good messaging software, but catered a lot to gaming. 
                Other competitors such as Slack and Microsoft Teams were dominating the professional space. 
                We interviewed ICS college students to find out what made Discord unprofessional, and designed personas and wireframes.
                I had fun learning all the acessiblity issues, what personas were, testing, and overall learning how to make a better more usable product for consumers.
                I had challenges learning figma and proper design techniques, and learning the best way to conduct interviews, getting more information while keeping the interviewee in a no stess enviroment.

                <h2 class = "bodyShrink portColorSize">
                    In this class project I learned a lot about software design and architechure, different diagrams that could be created and making pseudo code. 
                    We identified audiences, made wireframes, personas and various diagrams like use case flow, component diagrams, and UML diagrams.
                    I learned things such as keeping track of what we don't know, to keep elicitating, and always voicing my ideas.
                    We also looked back on our previous designs and discussed the strengths and weaknesses.
                    I thought putting together UML was challenging, but rewarding, and made me realize how important these diagrams were to seek deficiencies and strengths in design.

                <h2 class = "bodyShrink portColorSize">
                    Making this portfolio has benefitted me a lot, as I have learned and expierienced the making of an actual website. 
                    This project was fun and challenging, and I have always wanted my own website.
                    Learning how to do responsive design was a little challenging, but well worth it to reach as many people as possible.
                    I hope next time I can utilize and employ more JavaScript.
